- Specific tasks and deliverables for each week
- Technical implementation details
- Testing and validation procedures

#### Deliverables Checklist
- Comprehensive list of all deliverables
- Clear completion criteria for each deliverable
- Quality assurance and testing requirements
- Documentation and knowledge transfer requirements

#### Validation Criteria

### Quality Assurance Framework

#### Documentation Standards
- All documentation must be comprehensive and self-contained
- Technical specifications must include implementation details
- Execution prompts must be immediately actionable
- Integration points must be clearly defined

#### Testing Requirements
- Each phase must include comprehensive testing procedures
- Integration testing must be defined for all workstream interactions
- Performance testing must validate scalability requirements
- Security testing must validate compliance requirements

#### Validation Procedures
- Each deliverable must have clear acceptance criteria
