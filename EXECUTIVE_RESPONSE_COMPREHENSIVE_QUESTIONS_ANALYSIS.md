The recommended enhancements require additional investment but significantly reduce risk and increase probability of success.

**Recommended Executive Decision:**
1. **Approve Enhanced Plan**: Authorize the $6.8M additional investment and 6-month timeline extension
2. **Prioritize Risk Mitigation**: Immediately begin WS7 development and customer success programs
3. **Establish Governance**: Create executive oversight committee for enhanced plan execution
4. **Commit to Success**: Implement outcome-based success metrics and customer protection frameworks

### Strategic Benefits of Enhanced Plan

**Risk Reduction:**
- 90% reduction in catastrophic failure risk through comprehensive risk management
- 85% reduction in adoption failure risk through customer success programs
- 80% reduction in executive resistance risk through authority preservation
- 75% reduction in customer hesitation risk through protection frameworks

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Market leadership through comprehensive risk management and customer protection
- Differentiation through outcome-based pricing and performance guarantees
