## Security Validation Automation

### Automated Security Tests

Create a comprehensive security test script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# security-validation.sh

echo "🔒 Running Nexus Architect Security Validation"

# 1. Authentication Tests
echo "Testing authentication..."
./bdt/BDT-P1/security/local-auth-setup.sh test

# 2. SSL/TLS Tests
echo "Testing SSL/TLS configuration..."
./bdt/BDT-P1/security/local-ssl-setup.sh verify

# 3. Vulnerability Scans
echo "Running vulnerability scans..."
./bdt/BDT-P1/security/security-scan-local.sh

# 4. Compliance Checks
echo "Running compliance checks..."
./bdt/BDT-P1/security/compliance-check-local.sh all

# 5. Penetration Testing
echo "Running basic penetration tests..."
# XSS Tests
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"<script>alert(1)</script>"}' | grep -q "alert" && echo "❌ XSS vulnerability found" || echo "✅ XSS protection working"

# SQL Injection Tests
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin'\'''; DROP TABLE users; --","password":"test"}' | grep -q "error" && echo "✅ SQL injection protection working" || echo "❌ SQL injection vulnerability found"

echo "🎉 Security validation completed"
```

### Continuous Security Monitoring

Set up automated security checks:

```bash
# Add to crontab for daily security checks
0 2 * * * /home/ubuntu/nexus-architect/bdt/BDT-P1/security/security-validation.sh >> /var/log/security-check.log 2>&1

# Weekly vulnerability scans
0 3 * * 0 /home/ubuntu/nexus-architect/bdt/BDT-P1/security/security-scan-local.sh >> /var/log/vuln-scan.log 2>&1

# Monthly compliance checks
0 4 1 * * /home/ubuntu/nexus-architect/bdt/BDT-P1/security/compliance-check-local.sh all >> /var/log/compliance-check.log 2>&1
```

## Emergency Security Procedures

### Security Incident Response

If a security incident is detected:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   ```bash
   # Isolate affected systems
   docker-compose -f bdt/BDT-P1/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml down
   
   # Preserve evidence
   ./bdt/BDT-P1/scripts/backup-restore-local.sh backup
   
   # Document incident
   echo "$(date): Security incident detected" >> /var/log/security-incidents.log
   ```

2. **Investigation:**
   ```bash
   # Analyze logs
   grep -E "(failed|error|unauthorized)" logs/*.log
   
   # Check system integrity
   ./bdt/BDT-P1/security/security-scan-local.sh
   
   # Review access logs
   tail -100 /var/log/auth.log
   ```

3. **Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Apply security patches
   ./bdt/BDT-P1/scripts/install-dependencies.sh update
   
   # Reset compromised credentials
   ./bdt/BDT-P1/security/local-auth-setup.sh reset
   
   # Restore from clean backup if needed
   ./bdt/BDT-P1/scripts/backup-restore-local.sh restore CLEAN_BACKUP_ID
   ```
