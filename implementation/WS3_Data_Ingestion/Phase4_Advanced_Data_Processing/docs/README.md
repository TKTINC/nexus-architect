## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture

The WS3 Phase 4 architecture follows a microservices pattern with distributed processing capabilities, designed for horizontal scalability and fault tolerance. The system consists of three primary service layers: the processing layer, the extraction layer, and the quality assurance layer, each supported by robust infrastructure components including Apache Spark, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

The processing layer centers around the Advanced Data Processor, which orchestrates large-scale data transformations using Apache Spark's distributed computing framework. This service manages data ingestion from multiple sources, applies schema normalization and deduplication, performs temporal alignment, and executes cross-reference resolution. The processor supports both batch and streaming operations, enabling real-time data transformation alongside scheduled bulk processing operations.

The extraction layer is powered by the Knowledge Extractor, which implements multiple natural language processing techniques to automatically discover and extract meaningful information from unstructured text. This service combines rule-based pattern matching, statistical machine learning models, and deep learning approaches to achieve high accuracy in entity recognition, relationship extraction, event identification, and concept discovery.
