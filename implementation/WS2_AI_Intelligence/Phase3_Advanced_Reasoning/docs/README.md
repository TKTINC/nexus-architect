    neo4j_uri="bolt://neo4j-lb.nexus-knowledge-graph:7687",
    openai_api_key="your-key",
    anthropic_api_key="your-key"
)

# Perform logical inference
result = await reasoning_engine.perform_logical_inference(
    premises=[
        "All microservices require monitoring",
        "System X uses microservices architecture",
        "Monitoring requires observability tools"
    ],
    query="What does System X require?"
)
# Result: System X requires observability tools
```

#### Causal Analysis
```python
# Example: Causal relationship discovery
causal_result = await reasoning_engine.analyze_causal_relationships(
    variables=["response_time", "cpu_usage", "memory_usage", "user_load"],
    data_source="performance_metrics",
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)
# Discovers: user_load → cpu_usage → response_time (causal chain)
```

### Strategic Planning System

#### Multi-Criteria Decision Making
```python
# Example: Strategic decision analysis
planning_engine = StrategicPlanningEngine(
    neo4j_uri="bolt://neo4j-lb.nexus-knowledge-graph:7687",
    openai_api_key="your-key",
    anthropic_api_key="your-key"
)

decision_options = [
    DecisionOption(
        option_id="microservices_migration",
        name="Migrate to Microservices",
        scores={
            "cost_efficiency": 60,
            "implementation_speed": 40,

        risk_level=RiskLevel.HIGH
    )
]

recommendation = await planning_engine.make_strategic_decision(
    "How should we modernize our architecture?",
    decision_options
)
```

#### Resource Optimization
```python
# Example: Optimal resource allocation
optimization_result = await planning_engine.optimize_resource_allocation(
    initiatives=selected_initiatives,
    available_resources={
        "engineering_hours": 2000,
        "budget": 500000,
        "cloud_compute": 10000
    },
    constraints=["timeline_6_months", "budget_limited"]
)
```

### Autonomous Planning Framework

#### Self-Adaptive Planning
```python
# Example: Autonomous plan creation and execution
planning_framework = AutonomousPlanningFramework(
    neo4j_uri="bolt://neo4j-lb.nexus-knowledge-graph:7687",
    openai_api_key="your-key",
    anthropic_api_key="your-key"
)

# Create autonomous plan
context = PlanningContext(
    context_id="performance_optimization",
    environment_state={
        "cpu_utilization": 0.8,
        "response_time": 2.5,

    time_horizon=90
)

plan = await planning_framework.create_autonomous_plan(
    context,
    objectives=["improve_performance", "reduce_costs", "maintain_security"]
)

# Execute plan autonomously with continuous monitoring
execution_result = await planning_framework.execute_plan_autonomously(
    plan,
    monitoring_interval=60
)
```
