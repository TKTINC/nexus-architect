```python
# Redis cache configuration for optimal performance
redis_config = {
    'maxmemory': '512mb',
    'maxmemory-policy': 'allkeys-lru',
    'save': '900 1 300 10 60 10000',
    'tcp-keepalive': 60
}
```

#### Application Optimization

```python
# Optimize metrics collection with batch processing
def collect_metrics_batch():
    """Collect metrics in batches for better performance"""
    batch_size = 100
    metrics_batch = []
    
    for metric in collect_all_metrics():
        metrics_batch.append(metric)
        
        if len(metrics_batch) >= batch_size:
            process_metrics_batch(metrics_batch)
            metrics_batch = []
    
    # Process remaining metrics
    if metrics_batch:
        process_metrics_batch(metrics_batch)
```

## Monitoring

### Health Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive health monitoring capabilities for all components and services.

#### Component Health Checks

```python
def check_component_health():
    """Comprehensive component health check"""
    health_status = {
        'database': check_database_connectivity(),
        'redis': check_redis_connectivity(),
        'kubernetes': check_kubernetes_connectivity(),
        'docker': check_docker_connectivity(),
        'filesystem': check_filesystem_health(),
        'network': check_network_connectivity()
    }
    
    overall_health = all(health_status.values())
    
    return {
        'overall_health': overall_health,
        'components': health_status,
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

#### Performance Monitoring

```python
def monitor_performance_metrics():
    """Monitor key performance indicators"""
    performance_metrics = {
        'api_response_time': measure_api_response_time(),
        'metrics_collection_rate': measure_collection_rate(),
        'action_processing_time': measure_action_processing(),
        'memory_usage': psutil.virtual_memory().percent,
        'cpu_usage': psutil.cpu_percent(),
        'disk_usage': psutil.disk_usage('/').percent
    }
    
    return performance_metrics
```

### Alerting

#### Alert Configuration

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: high_cpu_usage
    condition: cpu_usage > 80
    severity: warning
    duration: 5m
    
  - name: critical_memory_usage
    condition: memory_usage > 95
    severity: critical
    duration: 1m
    
  - name: service_down
    condition: service_health == false
    severity: critical
    duration: 30s
```

# Configure logrotate for application logs
cat > /etc/logrotate.d/nexus-architect << EOF
/var/log/nexus-architect/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 30
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 644 nexus nexus
    postrotate
        systemctl reload nexus-architect
    endscript
}
EOF
```

#### Cache Maintenance

```python
def maintain_redis_cache():
    """Perform regular cache maintenance"""
    # Remove expired keys
    redis_client.execute_command('MEMORY', 'PURGE')
    
    # Optimize memory usage
    redis_client.config_set('maxmemory-policy', 'allkeys-lru')
